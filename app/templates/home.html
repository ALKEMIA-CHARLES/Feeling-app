                         As it appears, the human mind is not capable of not thinking, at least on the
                         subconscious
                        level.
                        Our mind is always occupied by thoughts, whether we want to or not, and they influence our
                        every
                        action.

                        When we were still children, our thoughts seemed to be purely positive. Have you ever been
                        around a
                        4-year old who doesn’t like a painting he or she drew? I haven’t. Instead, I see glee,
                        exciting and
                        pride in children’s eyes. But as the years go by, we clutter our mind with doubts, fears and
                        self-deprecating thoughts.

                        Just imagine then, how much we limit ourselves in every aspect of our lives if we give
                        negative
                        thoughts too much power!

                        We’ll never go after that job we’ve always wanted because our nay-saying thoughts make us
                        doubt our
                        abilities.

                        We’ll never ask that person we like out on a date because we always think we’re not good
                        enough.

                        We’ll never risk quitting our job in order to pursue the life and the work of our dreams
                        because we
                        can’t get over our mental barrier that insists we’re too weak, too unimportant and too dumb.

                        We’ll never lose those pounds that risk our health because we believe we’re not capable of
                        pushing
                        our limits.

                        And we’ll never be able to fully see our inner potential because we simply don’t dare to
                        question
                        the voices in our head…

                        But enough is enough! It’s time to stop these limiting beliefs and come to a place of
                        sanity, love
                        and excitement about life, work and ourselves.

                        So, how can we tap into the power of positivity?

                        “Happiness cannot come from without, it comes from within.” – Helen Keller

                        It’s not as hard as it may seem; you just have to practice, practice, practice. Here are 4
                        simple
                        yet powerful ideas on how you can get started.

                        <li style="  font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive;"> 1. Learn to substitute every negative
                            thought with a positive one.
                            Every time a negative thought crawls into your mind, replace it with a positive thought.
                            It’s just
                            like someone writes a phrase you don’t like on a blackboard and then you get up, erase it
                            and write
                            something much more to your liking.

                        <li style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; "> 2. See the positive side of every
                            situation, even when you are surrounded by pure
                            negativity.
                            This one is a bit harder to put into practice, which does not mean it’s impossible.

                        <li style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; "> You can find positivity in everything by
                            mentally holding on to something positive, whether
                            this be
                            family, friends, your faith, nature, someone’s sparkling eyes or whatever other glimmer of
                            beauty.

                        <li style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; "> If you seek it, you will find it.

                        <li style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; "> 3. At least once a day, take a moment and
                            think of 5 things you are grateful for.
                            This will lighten your mood and give you some perspective of what really is important in
                            life and
                            how many blessings surround you already.

                        <li style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; "> 4. Change the mental images you allow to
                            enter your mind.
                            How you see yourself and your surroundings make a huge difference to your thinking.

                            Instead of dwelling on dark, negative thoughts, consciously build and focus on positive,
                            light and
                            colorful images, thoughts and situations in your mind a few times a day.

                <h1 style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; ">Meditation</h1>
                <p style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; "> Meditation is an approach to training the mind,
                    similar to the way that fitness is an approach to
                    training the body. But many meditation techniques exist — so how do you learn how to meditate?

                    “In Buddhist tradition, the word ‘meditation’ is equivalent to a word like ‘sports’ in the U.S. It’s
                    a family of activities, not a single thing,” University of Wisconsin neuroscience lab director
                    Richard J. Davidson, Ph.D., told The New York Times. And different meditation practices require
                    different mental skills.

                    It’s extremely difficult for a beginner to sit for hours and think of nothing or have an “empty
                    mind.” We have some tools such as a beginner meditation DVD or a brain-sensing headband to help you
                    through this process when you are starting out. In general, the easiest way to begin meditating is
                    by focusing on the breath — an example of one of the most common approaches to meditation:
                    concentration.

                    CONCENTRATION MEDITATION
                    Concentration meditation involves focusing on a single point. This could entail following the
                    breath, repeating a single word or mantra, staring at a candle flame, listening to a repetitive
                    gong, or counting beads on a mala. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate
                    for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations.

                    In this form of meditation, you simply refocus your awareness on the chosen object of attention each
                    time you notice your mind wandering. Rather than pursuing random thoughts, you simply let them go.
                    Through this process, your ability to concentrate improves.

                    MINDFULNESS MEDITATION
                    Mindfulness meditation encourages the practitioner to observe wandering thoughts as they drift
                    through the mind. The intention is not to get involved with the thoughts or to judge them, but
                    simply to be aware of each mental note as it arises.

                    Through mindfulness meditation, you can see how your thoughts and feelings tend to move in
                    particular patterns. Over time, you can become more aware of the human tendency to quickly judge an
                    experience as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. With practice, an inner balance develops.

                    In some schools of meditation, students practice a combination of concentration and mindfulness.
                    Many disciplines call for stillness — to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the teacher.

                            Satie have become synonymous with relaxation and peaceful times. The first of the set is

                            Planets)
                            After being introduced to astrology in 1913, Gustav Holst was inspired to pen a suite based
                            on the
                            planets of the solar system and their corresponding Roman deities. And it’s an absolute
                            masterpiece
                            of
                            20th-century orchestral music. The second movement, 'Venus', is a beautiful yet mystic
                            homage to the
                            Goddess of love, beauty, desire and prosperity. The solo passages in the horn and violin are
                            exquisitely
                            tranquil – just what you need in those moments before hitting the hay.
                        <li style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; ">3. Chopin – Nocturne No.2, Op.9
                            Frédéric Chopin is undoubtedly one of the masters of the Romantic era, writing an abundance
                            of
                            beautiful, relaxing works for piano. This stunning nocturne was written when he was just 20
                            years
                            old and overflows with delicate beauty, perfect for a relaxing late night. This is one to
                            dive into
                            with that late-night chamomile tea.
                        <li style=" font-family: 'Indie Flower', cursive; ">4. Ravel – Piano Concerto in G major (2nd
                            movement)
                            Though at first this may sound like a solo piano piece, eventually the beautiful entry of a
                            flute
                            confirms the presence of the orchestra to accompany the exquisite piano melody with
                            curiously
                            gorgeous harmonies. This waltz is pleasantly serene and its idyllic tone is the perfect
                            recipe for
                            a night of slumber.

                            movement)
                            The quiet masterpiece that is the first movement of this famous piano sonata by Beethoven is
                            completely ideal for drifting off. The gentle arpeggiated figures in the right hand
                            accompanied by
                            sustained notes in the left create alluring harmonies, which perfectly set this nocturnal
                            mood.
                            Listen and drift away...
